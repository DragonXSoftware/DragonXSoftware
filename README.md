- ⚡ Fun fact: A shot is called a shot because in the old west they used to have no money so sometimes you would trade for items, a shot of wiskey went
- for about 12 cents and so did a bullet, so you would just walk into a saloon and put a bullet on the bar, the barkeep would pour you a shot of wiskey
- and so we got the coined saying: "Pour me a 'shot'".
